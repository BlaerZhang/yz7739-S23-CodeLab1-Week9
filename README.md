# Glossophobian's Speech 
(Prototype)

You are a nervous speaker.
You have limited time to speak each word.
But your mind goes wild and random.
Try to brain storm to search for the word you need.
But also try to take use of those "blanking" words to recover your mind capacity.
Now it's your turn.
Good Luck.
